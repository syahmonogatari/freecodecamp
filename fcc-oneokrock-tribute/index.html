    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>One Ok Rock, stylized as ONE OK ROCK (pronounced in Japanese as "one o'clock"), is a Japanese rock band formed in Tokyo, Japan in 2005.
    The band's name, ONE OK ROCK, comes from "one o'clock", the time that the band used to practice on weekends. They chose to play at one o'clock
     in the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during such hours. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no distinction
      between R's and L's, they changed "O'CLOCK" to "O'CROCK" (or "O'KROCK"), which was then separated to become "OK ROCK".</p>

      <h2>Musical Influences and Style</h2>
      <p>ONE OK ROCK's music is influenced by Linkin Park, Foo Fighters, Good Charlotte, and Ellegarden. In their sixth album Jinsei×Boku=, they expressed
         how this album was influenced by Linkin Park's and Coldrain's screaming and yell-rapping. Their new seventh album 35xxxv, was produced along with
          producer John Feldmann who also worked with 5 Seconds of Summer, The Used, and Sleeping With Sirens. The album was described as "too Americanized"
           by international fans, yet it managed to get the first place on the Oricon Album weekly ranking, making it the first time the band had reached the
            top of the list. Fans are in constant dispute over their dynamic music style change as new albums release different sounds.</p>
